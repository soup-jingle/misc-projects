Hard links are names which point to the inode of an already existing file. Symbolic links, on the other hand, only point to the /name/ of another file. In the case of symbolic links, if the name of the original file (the one the symbolic link points to) is changed, the symbolic link no longer works, because it cannot find the name of the file it points to. Same if the original file is deleted, except that it is not only that the symbolic link cannot find that file, the file is completely removed from the system. That would not matter in the case of hard links. Both keep a handle on an inode, and only when all files (links) pointing to that inode are removed is that data actually deleted from the system.

One read per directory makes four: '/', 'dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3'. \\
One read per each "thing" in the directory to find its i-node makes another four: 'dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3', 'myfile'.
